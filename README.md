The idea with this project is to combine my skills obtained through the 100Devs online bootcamp, AWS ReStart, and my own personal studies in software engineering with the decade of knowledge I've obtained in my career as a green roof installer and rooftop farmer.

1. The first step was to draw out a wireframe and plan my thoughts behind the page more fully. My goals are to:

I. Construct a homepage that outlines Project Plants ambitions to facilitate and create more green space in urban areas, how green roofs can help, how they fit in the climate resilience toolkit and particularly why NYC- laws,capital,space
II. Outline why this project is specifically of interest to me. My background and previous projects worked on in NY and CO
III. Provide a case study showing projects in NYC, who built them, size and cost if possible. This could be stored in a database to be continually updated. This page would also include a green roof calculator that would use an input slider that takes in a % of rooftops covered with greenspace in the city and one that has average soil depth options from one inch to 8inch, in order to provide the user with lbs of carbon potentially sequestered in soil and how many gallons of water could be captured in a storm surge
IV. The last page would use the congress api to reflect latest activity on green roof and urban agriculture bills nationwide and currently active legislation. It would also have an area to reflect relevant news from around the globe
V. This all we be hosted on AWS using S3 buckets and route53. More notes on backend/network configuration to come

2. This crude sketch was then turned into a Figma wireframe and brandkit

--- still needs work on the brandkit
